  :alt: A selection of bookshelves

Have YOU ever wanted to make a bookshelf out of leaves, coral, lava or any other completely unrealistic material? Well, now you can!

`minetest-game <https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/>`__ provides a single bookshelf made out of default wood.

This mod provides (as standard) bookshelves made out of forty additional materials.

You can easily add or remove bookshelves; just open the init.lua file in a text editor, and add or remove lines from the list. You can create a bookshelf out of (almost) any material: as long as minetest can retrieve the texture, than decoshelves can use that texture.
